### Install Kickstart

> [!NOTE]
> [Backup](#faq) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Find your configuration under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |

#### Recommended Step

[Fork](https://github.com/byfnoel/configs.git) this repo so that you have
your own copy that you can modify. Then install by cloning the fork to your
machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

> [!NOTE]
> Your fork's URL will be something like this:
> `https://github.com/byfnoel/configs.git`

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file too
and track it in version control.

#### Clone the repo

> [!NOTE]
> If following the recommended step above (i.e., forking the repo), replace
> `nvim-lua` with `<your_github_username>` in the commands below

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/byfnoel/configs.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view

information about extending and exploring Neovim. That also includes
examples of adding popularly requested plugins.
